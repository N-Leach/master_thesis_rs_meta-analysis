In 2015, all United Nations member states adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to address global challenges such as climate change, environmental degradation, poverty, and inequality [@un_desa_sustainable_2023; @un-ggim2019]. This international plan outlines 17 global goals to achieve a better and more sustainable future [@un_desa_sustainable_2023; @un-ggim2019; @unitednations2024]. Having passed the midpoint of the SDGs' timeline with significant setbacks, the critical role of timely and high-quality data has never been more apparent [@unitednations2024; @un_desa_sustainable_2023]. These data are vital to identifying challenges, formulating evidence-based solutions, monitoring the implementation of solutions, and making essential course corrections [@un-ggim2019]. However, despite this necessity for high-quality data, traditional monitoring approaches, such as household- or field-level surveys (ground-acquired data), remain the primary source of data collection for key indicators of SDGs by National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) [@burke2021; @un-ggim2019]. These methods are expensive and time-consuming to conduct [@burke2021]. As a result, the frequency of ground-acquired data varies significantly around the world; for example, the most recent agricultural census for 24% of the world's countries was more than 15 years ago [@burke2021]. Recognizing this challenge, both the United Nations SDG Report [-@un_desa_sustainable_2023, pp.49] and the Global Working Group on Big Data for Official Statistics underscore the importance of innovative methodology and data sources, including remote sensing and machine learning, to enhance the monitoring and implementation of the SDGs [@un-ggim2019; @unitednations2017]. Â 

Remote sensing --- data collected from a distance via satellite, aircraft, or drones --- offers a cost-effective approach for monitoring wide-ranging geographic areas [@un-ggim2019; @zhao_overview_2022; @maso2023; @khatami2016]. Remote sensing imagery has been limited to agricultural and socioeconomic applications for decades [@zhang_review_2022; @burke2021; @lavallin_machine_2021]. For instance, the Laboratory for Applications of Remote Sensing (LARS) has utilized satellite data and machine learning methods for crop identification since the 1960s [@holloway_statistical_2018]. However, in recent years, there has been a considerable increase in the spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution of remote sensing data, alongside a significant increase in free sensor data and computational power for complex data analysis [@zhang_review_2022; @burke2021; @thapa_deep_2023]. The magnitude of possible applications and increased availability of remote sensing data have rapidly increased the number of published research papers in this field [@khatami2016; @burke2021]. Earth observation satellites alone can measure 42% of the SDG targets [@zhang_review_2022].

Despite the increased research, machine learning and remote sensing for SDG monitoring, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the factors that determine the performance of these models across different contexts. The success of machine learning models in remote sensing depends on various factors, including the quality and resolution of input data, the choice of algorithm, the sample's representativeness, and the complexity of the landscape [@heydari2018; @lu2007]. Additionally, model performance is often evaluated using localized datasets, which can limit the generalisability of findings and the ability to apply these models in broader contexts [@burke2021; @khatami2016; @unitednations2017].

Although the uptake of remote sensing data by NSIs has been slow, many NSIs are now capitalizing on the potential of using new and consistent data sources and methodologies to support and inform official statistics [@unitednations2017]. These can be generated by combining geospatial information, RS, and other big data sources, allowing for the filling of data gaps, providing information where no measurements were previously made, and improving the temporal and spatial resolutions of data (e.g., daily updates on crop area and yield statistics). Despite these advances, this paradigm shift from traditional statistical methods---such as counting and measuring by humans---towards estimation from sensors, simulation, and modeling, presents challenges [@unitednations2017]. It requires convincing, statistically sound results, rigorous validation, and a significant shift in resources within institutions to adapt to the higher spatial and temporal resolutions necessary to address emerging policy questions [@unitednations2017].

A meta-analysis statistically combines the body of evidence on a specific topic, aiming to produce unbiased summaries of evidence [@iliescu2022]. There are many potential methods to choose from to combine results. One choice that is made when conducting a meta-analysis is whether to use the study's sample size to weigh the result of each study (sample-weighted estimate) or an unweighted approach, which treats all results equally, disregarding sample size [@hall2018]. The current standard in meta-analysis research is to use the sample-weighted estimate [@hall2018]. The literature examined in this study found that previous meta-analyses investigating the performance of machine learning models on remote sensing data have predominantly relied on unweighted approaches. This meta-analysis is performed on peer-reviewed research articles that use machine learning methods and remote sensing data to monitor SDGs. This study aims to: (1) estimate the average performance (summary effect size); (2) determine the degree of heterogeneity within and across studies; (3) assess whether specific study features influence model performance; and (4) compare the sample-weighted and unweighted estimate summary effect.
