# Master Thesis: Remote Sensing Meta-Analysis

This repository contains all the materials and data associated with my masterâ€™s thesis: **Evaluating the Performance of Machine Learning Models in Remote Sensing for Sustainable Development Goals: A Meta-Analysis**. This project aims to assess how machine learning models perform in remote sensing applications relevant to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using meta-analysis techniques.

You can access the HTML version of the thesis and the code used for analysis on my GitHub Pages [here](https://n-leach.github.io/master_thesis_rs_meta-analysis/).
